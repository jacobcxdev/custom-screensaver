This project is technically not licensed by any means, as it uses copywrited QML code from LG.

Butâ€¦ I don't really care too much, as this repository is only really intended for my personal use, and LG's code can be easily found in the webOS firmware.

So, use at your own risk.

LG, feel free to email me @ me@jacobcx.dev if you want me to remove your files from this repository.
